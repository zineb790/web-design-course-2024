Objectives:
Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience.
Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web application.
Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.
Requirements:
Cache at least one element using selectElementById.
Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll.
Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.).
Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.
Create at least one element using createElement.
Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM.
Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content. 
Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.
Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties.
Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.
Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.
Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.
Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.
Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)
Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
